EtfTypeId_CDescr=Hardware device which is part of a processor and executes software.
EtfTypeId_CName=Core
EtfTypeId_ECUDescr=Hardware device which has at least one processor.
EtfTypeId_ECUName=Electronic Control Unit
EtfTypeId_IBDescr=Sub-fraction of a Runnable
EtfTypeId_IBName=Instruction Block
EtfTypeId_ISRDescr=Object handled by Interrupt-Management Unit and calling all \u201CTop-Level\u201D Runnables. An ISR is the specialization of a Process type.
EtfTypeId_ISRName=Interrupt-Service-Routine
EtfTypeId_PDescr=Hardware device which has at least one core.
EtfTypeId_PName=Processor
EtfTypeId_RDescr=Object, called by a Process or another Runnable.
EtfTypeId_RName=Runnable
EtfTypeId_SCHEDDescr=Part of operating system which assigns processes to cores.
EtfTypeId_SCHEDName=Scheduler
EtfTypeId_SEMDescr=Operating system object, for restricting access to resources.
EtfTypeId_SEMName=Semaphore
EtfTypeId_SIGDescr=Shared data object (e.g. variable) in a software.
EtfTypeId_SIGName=Signal
EtfTypeId_SIMDescr=Trigger point for a Task or ISR
EtfTypeId_SIMName=Simulation
EtfTypeId_STIDescr=Trigger point for a Task or ISR
EtfTypeId_STIName=Stimulus
EtfTypeId_TDescr=Object handled by OS Scheduler, and calling all "Top-Level" Runnables. A Task is the specialization of a Process type.
EtfTypeId_TName=Task
EtfTypeId_SYSDescr=System process.
EtfTypeId_SYSName=System
EtfTypeId_IDescr=Interrupt service routine.
EtfTypeId_IName=Interrupt
ETFPayload_Activate=Process instance is activated by a stimulus
ETFPayload_BoundedMigration=When last executing core of previous instance is not equal to first executing core of this instance
ETFPayload_EnforcedMigration=When a process migrates at a predefined position in execution to another scheduler.
ETFPayload_FullMigration=When the executing core before a suspend is not equal to new executing core and there is a schedule point right before this execution
ETFPayload_MapLimitExceeded=When there are more process instances of this process as the MPA-LIMIT value (MPA = MultipleProcessActivation)
ETFPayload_Park=Active waiting process instance is suspended by another process.
ETFPayload_PhaseMigration=When the executing core before a suspend is not equal to the new executing core and there is no schedule point right before this execution
ETFPayload_Poll=Process instance has requested a resource by polling (active waiting) which is not available
ETFPayload_PollParking=Parking process instance is allocated to the core and again polls (i.e. actively waits) for a resource.
ETFPayload_Preempt=Executing process instance is stopped by the scheduler, e.g. because of a higher priority process which is activated.
ETFPayload_Release=OS EVENT which was requested by a process is set (see OSEK 2.2.3 Extended Task Model, SET_Event()) and process is ready to proceed execution.
ETFPayload_ReleaseParking=Resource which is requested by parking process instance becomes available, but parking process stays suspended and changes to READY state.
ETFPayload_Resume=Suspended process instance continues execution on the same or other core.
ETFPayload_Run=Process instance resumes execution after polling (i.e. active waiting) for a resource
ETFPayload_Start=Process instance is allocated to the core and starts execution for the first time
ETFPayload_Terminate=Process instance has finished execution
ETFPayload_Wait=Process has requested a non-set OS EVENT (see OSEK 2.2.3 Extended Task Model, WAIT_Event() ).
